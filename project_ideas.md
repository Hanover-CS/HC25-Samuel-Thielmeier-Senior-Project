# My Project Ideas
## Idea 1: IOS / Android Mobile game
<p> I want to make a relatively simple rouge-like mobile game. I want it to be like a dungeon crawler
that takes insparation from the classic top-down <b>Legend of Zelda</b> games. I was thinking of a rouge-like because I think it would be easier to wipe the user's progress if they died, then to try to work out
a checkpoint type of system. I want it to be the user exploring a dungeon, and has to maybe flip several
levers to continue on, with enimes becoming stronger and spawning in greater numbers the further down
the user decends.</p>

## Idea 2: A Notes / Password Manager
