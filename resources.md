# Idea 1: Rougelike Game

<p>A lot of the games shown on the site, while rougelikes are mainly <b>turn-based</b> games. I want to create a <b>real-time</b> game where the user has to actievly be moving around to dodge/block attacks.
I want my game to remind the user of the classic <b>Legend of Zelda</b> game that originally came out on the <b>NES</b>.</p>

<p>One of the games on the site mentioned above <b>Rouge Fable III</b> offeres multiple different classes for the user to try. As I think that would be too much to start with, it will be something I keep
on the back burner in my mind as something I want to try to implement</p>
