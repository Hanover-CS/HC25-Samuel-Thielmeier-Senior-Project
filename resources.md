# Idea 1: Rougelike Game

## Link to Phaser's main site
<p>https://phaser.io/</p>
<p>The phaser game engine is an opensource resource that enables anyone to code their own web game with the engine. You can pay for a subscription to get access to the Phaser editor, but I don't really feel a need to
because I've worked with the engine before back in my freshman year. So since I'm already familiar with a lot of the mechanics the engine offers, which the phaser editor helps with simplifying the work I don't need to use the editor.</p>

## Link to Phaser Rougelike games

<p>A lot of the games shown on the site, while rougelikes are mainly <b>turn-based</b> games. I want to create a <b>real-time</b> game where the user has to actievly be moving around to dodge/block attacks.
I want my game to remind the user of the classic <b>Legend of Zelda</b> game that originally came out on the <b>NES</b>.</p>

<p>One of the games on the site mentioned above <b>Rouge Fable III</b> offeres multiple different classes for the user to try. As I think that would be too much to start with, it will be something I keep
on the back burner in my mind as something I want to try to implement</p>

## Link to Godot Documentation Resource
<p>https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/resources.html</p>
<p>Godot is another game engine/editor, but looks to offer a lot more resources than phaser. Both Godot and Phaser are both open source, but the editor for Godot is free which makes me debate using it versus Phaser. It is much more versitile, it boasts a number of different features. One of which is the ability to directly edit assets in the editor with Sprite Painter.</p>

<p> While I probably will just be sticking to a standard 2D game, Godot's engine makes it easy to code very beautiful 2D & 3D games. I think the sprite painter feature will also make it easier to create attack animations by just editing whatever spritesheet I use for my main character. Below are some screenshots from popular games made with Godot.</p>

## Link to game engine discussion
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/rrg0z4/what_is_a_good_engine_to_make_2d_games_in/</p>
<p>The reddit thread above links to a discussion deciding the best engine to make a 2d game in. The consitent suggestions throughout the thread are: Godot, Unity, and Construct 3. Unity is better for 3D games,
and actually renders 2D games as 3D, which accourding to some users can cause some unwanted errors with the camera. Construct 3, appears to be a great choice for 2D games, and offers a simplifed way to create the game with minimal coding.</p>
