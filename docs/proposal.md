# My Project's Features

## Gameplay Goals
<p>The game I plan to create will be a rougelike. I want to my game to be the user exploring a dungeon I will create, possibly with multiple floors. Enemies will be scattered throughout this dungeon, with the
number / strength of the enimes increasing the further in the user explores.</p>

## Gameplay Assets I plan to use
<p>I have found multiple community made assets on the Godot Asset page. Of the assets I found that I <b>know</b> I will be using, are: </p>
<p>Simple Enemy AI -> Will make it so that enemies that see the player will follow the player, and I will be adding functionality to attack the player.</p>

<p>Better Terrain -> A community made tool to make creating maps a more streamline experience, which will make it easier for me to create a more customizable map. Additionally, with whatever maps I create
the API makes it easier to update/customize them from code</p>
