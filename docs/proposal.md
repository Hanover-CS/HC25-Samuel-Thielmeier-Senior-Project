# My Project's Features

## Gameplay Goals
<p>The game I plan to create will be a rougelike. I want to my game to be the user exploring a dungeon I will create, possibly with multiple floors. Enemies will be scattered throughout this dungeon, with the
number / strength of the enimes increasing the further in the user explores.</p>

## Gameplay Assets I plan to use
<p>I have found multiple community made assets on the Godot Asset page.</p>
