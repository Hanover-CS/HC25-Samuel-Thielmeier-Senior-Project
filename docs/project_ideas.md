# My Project Ideas
## Idea 1: IOS / Android Mobile game
<p> I want to make a relatively simple rouge-like mobile game. I want it to be like a dungeon crawler
that takes insparation from the classic top-down <b>Legend of Zelda</b> games. I was thinking of a rouge-like because I think it would be easier to wipe the user's progress if they died, then to try to work out
a checkpoint type of system. I want it to be the user exploring a dungeon, and has to maybe flip several
levers to continue on, with enimes becoming stronger and spawning in greater numbers the further down
the user decends.Probably would code in Kotlin since apps/games in kotlin are able to run on both IOS and Andriod.</p>

## Idea 2: A Notes / Password Manager app
<p> So my mom has trouble keeping track of all her passwords or important info she stores in the notes app on her phone. She finds the the way the google password manager works inconvient when it doesn't always give the option to auto put in her password, and gets confused about where to go to find her passwords. I want to make possible an app with an easy to read UI that is less overwhelming and easier for organiztion purposes.</p>

## Idea 3: A online Multi-User Note / Text Editor website
<p> For a lot of classes at hanover, students are already sharing their personal notes between each other. I was thinking of creating a site that perhaps could be a resource for students provided by Hanover. So that I could possibly by defualt group students from one course together to a note taking repository, where everyone can share their personal notes. Students could sign in with their hanover credintials, which would be used to determine their courses they are in, and give the students access to the course notes.</p>
